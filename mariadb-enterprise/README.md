# MariaDB Kubernetes 

MariaDB Kubernetes provides a HelmChart supporting multiple topologies, including MariaDB Server with MaxScale and master/slave or Galera replication for highly available transactional workloads, or MariaDB ColumnStore for analytical workloads.

For complete documentation of the MariaDB Kubernetes Operator, its installation and usage, see the [MariaDB Knowledge Base](http://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/kubernetes).

> **Note**: MariaDB Kubernetes is an early-access release.  It is strongly recommended that you *not* use this release in production environments.  We are currently testing it for stability with a few customers.  Contact MariaDB Corporation for production support.
